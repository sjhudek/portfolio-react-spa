# React Portfolio
## User Story

As a prospective employer, actively seeking candidates proficient in constructing sophisticated single-page applications, I desire to navigate through a candidate’s live, React-based portfolio, showcasing diverse work samples. This will facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of their suitability for available roles, allowing me to discern their technical prowess, creativity, and problem-solving abilities in real-world scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Effortless Navigation:

- - Employers should be able to easily navigate through the portfolio to view different React work samples without any hassle.

- Showcasing Deployed React Applications:

- - The portfolio must prominently display deployed single-page applications built using React to allow employers to assess the candidate’s hands-on experience and proficiency.

- Detailed Insight into Projects:

- - Each showcased project should include concise yet comprehensive details about the goals, challenges, and solutions involved, enabling employers to gain a clear understanding of the candidate’s problem-solving skills.

- Direct Access to Live Work Samples:

- - Employers should have immediate access to live demonstrations or links to the deployed projects to assess the functionality and user experience directly.

- Visible and Accessible Contact Details:

- - The candidate’s contact information and professional networking links should be readily available and easy to find for further communication or inquiries.

- Responsive and Optimized Design:

- - The portfolio website should maintain optimal performance and visual consistency across various devices and browsers to ensure a smooth user experience for employers.

This portfolio website will serve as an efficient and effective medium for employers to evaluate the candidate’s capabilities and experience in building single-page applications using React.

## Usage
- Source: https://github.com/bobangajicsm/react-portfolio-website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
